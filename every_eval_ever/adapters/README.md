# Adapters

One-off adapter scripts that fetch leaderboard data from external sources and convert it to the Every Eval Ever schema. These are run manually, not via the main CLI.

## Writing a new adapter

Start from the `eee-dataset-conversion` agent skill —
[`.agents/skills/eee-dataset-conversion/SKILL.md`](../../.agents/skills/eee-dataset-conversion/SKILL.md).
It carries the field semantics, the merge-gate checks (`reference/datastore-gate.md`),
runnable templates, and the datastore submission mechanics. `tests/test_skill_conversion.py`
re-validates those templates against the live validator, so they stay current.

## Usage

Each adapter is run with `uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.<name>.adapter`.

## The automation contract

[`catalog.py`](catalog.py) declares which adapters the daily ingestion run may
execute, the datastore collections each may write, the exact argv that keeps its
output out of the checkout, and how long it may take. Every adapter package must
appear there or in `LEGACY_ADAPTERS`, and `tests/test_adapter_catalog.py` checks
each entry against the adapter's own parser, so a renamed flag fails a test rather
than a scheduled run. It is called the catalog, not the registry, because "the
registry" in this project is [`eval-card-registry`](https://github.com/evaleval/eval-card-registry).

An adapter that automation runs must therefore:

- expose `parse_args(argv: list[str] | None = None)` at module level;
- accept `--output-dir`, and write **only** under it;
- write records at `<output>/…/<developer>/<model>/{uuid4}.json`; the runner refuses
  anything else, including a collection the catalog did not declare;
- account for dropped source rows through `SourceConversionResult` +
  `save_failure_report` + a non-zero exit, which is what lets a partial refresh be
  told apart from a crash.

`bfcl`, `cocoabench` and `sciarena` are registered as `runnable=False` because
they need a local input file and have no live fetch path. `drug_interaction_papers`
and `paperswithcode` are also registered as `runnable=False`, but for different
reasons: the former retains an independent source-verification gate, while the
latter still needs an approved dump-pinning, raw-capture, and unresolved-metric
automation design.

## Raw source snapshots

[`helpers/raw_capture.py`](../helpers/raw_capture.py) keeps the bytes an adapter
converted, so a later correction can be checked against the input. It is inert unless
`EEE_RAW_CAPTURE_DIR` is set, which only the cron does, so a manual run is unchanged.

Adapters that fetch through `helpers.fetch.fetch_json` / `fetch_csv` are captured
without any adapter code. An adapter with its own HTTP call site calls
`raw_capture.record(...)` there. A source already addressable at a revision, such as
a Hugging Face dataset or a git clone, records a pointer with
`raw_capture.record_hf_dataset(...)` / `record_git_checkout(...)` rather than
re-hosting bytes that are already durably stored.

Emits 4 aggregate metrics plus per-category and per-text-complexity breakdowns (40 scores per model). |
| `drug_interaction_papers` | Primary-paper aggregate tables | Converts frozen LLMDDI, TextDDI, ZeroDDI, ExDDI, and DTI-LM result tables into eight protocol-qualified study/dataset collections without redistributing DrugBank records. |
| `paperswithcode` | Papers with Code PostgreSQL dumps | Converts aggregate PwC evaluation rows, with registry-backed metric semantics and an optional fail-closed DrugBank protocol-qualification overlay. |

### Drug-interaction paper results

The offline `drug_interaction_papers` adapter converts 548 frozen result cells
from five primary-paper snapshots into 99 aggregate logs across eight
study/dataset collections. It preserves paper-native protocol distinctions such
as chronological unseen drugs, one- and two-unseen-drug induction, unseen-relation
CZSL/GZSL, and DTI warm/cold-drug/cold-protein evaluation rather than collapsing
everything under a generic DrugBank label.

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.drug_interaction_papers.adapter \
  --audit-only \
  --audit-output /tmp/drug-interaction-source-audit.json

uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.drug_interaction_papers.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-drug-interaction-data
```

The checked-in bundles contain aggregate paper tables only: no drug identifiers,
descriptions, SMILES strings, protein sequences, or instance-level DrugBank
records. Hashes, anchors, negative controls, exact counts, schema checks, and
atomic publication tests establish internal integrity, but not independent
transcription verification. The catalog therefore keeps this adapter
`runnable=False`, and the experiment plan keeps release gates G1/G5 blocked until
a materially separate reviewer verifies the source cells. See
[`drug_interaction_papers/README.md`](drug_interaction_papers/README.md).

### Papers with Code

The `paperswithcode` adapter reads a local PostgreSQL custom-format dump or
fetches the latest dump from `huggingface/paperswithcode-backups`, then converts
one aggregate result per PwC evaluation-row metric. Install the optional dump
reader through the project extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra paperswithcode
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.paperswithcode.adapter \
  --dump /path/to/paperswithcode.dump \
  --dataset-slug drugbank \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-pwc
```

A generic `drugbank` selection means only that PwC attached the row to the
DrugBank dataset slug. It does not establish transductive, inductive, relation-OOD,
or DTI cold-start semantics. The optional qualification layer is separate from
the generic converter and applies only reviewed, exact-dump overlay entries with
stable row anchors, explicit metric selectors, a complete metrics-payload
SHA-256, and primary-source evidence. The packaged production overlay is empty,
so no real PwC row is reclassified by default. See
[`paperswithcode/DRUGBANK_PROTOCOL_SCOPE.md`](paperswithcode/DRUGBANK_PROTOCOL_SCOPE.md)
and
[`paperswithcode/METRIC_MAINTENANCE.md`](paperswithcode/METRIC_MAINTENANCE.md).

### Mercor Evaluation Exports

Set the API key in the environment and run the adapter:

```bash
export MERCOR_EVAL_API_EVALEVAL_KEY="<your-key>"
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.mercor_eval.adapter
```

For a credential-free offline smoke run:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.mercor_eval.adapter \
  --input-json tests/data/mercor_eval/api_payload.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/mercor-eval-offline
```

The adapter exports aggregate leaderboard metrics only. Mercor's criterion
results do not include the task input, model output, messages, or answer
attribution required by the EEE instance-level schema.
Records are generated under benchmark-specific datastore directories, for
example `data/apex-agents/<developer>/<model>/<uuid>.json`. Generated records
are intended for the Hugging Face datastore submission, not the GitHub adapter
PR.

### LEXam

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.lexam.adapter --output-dir data
```

One record per model, with one result per published leaderboard column:

| Metric | Evaluation | Scale | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Question Judge Score | `lexam.open_question` | `[0,100]` | test split, n=2,541, scored by a pointwise-minimum ensemble of three judges |
| Multiple-Choice Accuracy | `lexam.mcq_4_choices` | `[0,1]` | n=1,655; the 4-choice config only, not the 8/16/32-choice ones |

The site prints both columns as percentages. Each is emitted on the scale of
its registry metric, with the published percentage kept in
`score_details.details`.

Model ids, metric ids, bounds and direction come from the eval-card-registry
through `registry_snapshot.json`, which vendors the entities this adapter emits
and is pinned to the registry revision they came from. The tests fail if an
emitted value drifts from the pin, so regenerate it after a registry change:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.lexam.refresh_registry_snapshot \
    --registry /path/to/eval-card-registry
```

Add `--check` to test the pin without writing: it exits non-zero and names both
revisions. Metric `review_status` is read from the snapshot, so a metric
promoted upstream needs a refresh rather than a code change.

Inference settings, serving and standard errors are not on the leaderboard;
they come from the paper (arXiv:2505.12864v7 §3.3, appendix F, Tables 1 and 10)
and from LEXam's own runner, `litellm_eval.py`, which names the served model for
15 of the 36 rows. Each record cites the source it used, and a standard error is
attached only while the scraped score still equals the published one.

Submission follows the datastore mechanics in the conversion skill. One
adapter-specific caveat: record filenames are fresh uuids per run, so a second
`upload_folder` onto an open submission PR adds another copy of every model.
Update a submission by deleting `data/lexam/` and adding the new records in a
single `create_commit`.

## Notes

- These are one-off scripts, not integrated into the main CLI.
- Live-source adapters require network access; `drug_interaction_papers` is
  offline and `paperswithcode` can replay a local dump.
- Some adapters (e.g. `rewardbench`, `helm`) may take several minutes to complete due to the number of models.
- Run `uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.<name>.adapter --help` for adapter-specific options.
- Generated adapter outputs under `data/<source>/` and saved raw payloads are
  generated artifacts. Prefer temporary output paths for smoke runs unless a
  data refresh is intentionally part of the change.

### Legacy integrations

`livecodebenchpro` is retained for historical and offline use, but its
upstream source is no longer usable for an active refresh. It is excluded
from active-adapter migration and compliance requirements. Deterministic
offline tests for its existing behavior may remain in the test suite.

`arc_agi` left this list on 2026-08-12: its old endpoint
(`/media/data/leaderboard/evaluations.json`) is gone, but the leaderboard
itself is live, rendered from JSON files under
`https://arcprize.org/media/data/`. The adapter now fetches those
(evaluations, models, providers, datasets), takes each model's developer
from the provider table instead of name heuristics, and is scheduled daily.

`mercor_eval` is paused: its Exports API is broken upstream as of
2026-08-12, so the catalog marks it `runnable=False` until Mercor serves
data again. The adapter itself is healthy and still runs by hand; it exits
`75` on an unreachable API and `1` on a rejected key.

`helm_*` and `rewardbench` are paused for staleness rather than breakage:
HELM's leaderboards are effectively static and RewardBench has not updated
in a while, so a weekly refresh refetches unchanged data. Both sources
still serve, both adapters still run by hand, and re-enabling either is one
`runnable` flip in the catalog.

### Partial conversions and provenance

An adapter may encounter a source row or metric that cannot be represented as
a valid EEE record—for example, a missing model identity or a non-numeric
score. It still writes every valid record. It also writes a strict JSON
provenance report under `adapter_reports/`, outside `data/`, with the source
reference, raw source fragment when available, and reason for each omission.
The command then exits non-zero so automation can distinguish a complete
refresh from a partial one.

Intentional non-evaluation rows, such as a published random baseline, are
recorded as exclusions in the same report but do not make the command fail.
The report is not an `EvaluationLog` and must not be passed to the validator.

### Vals.ai

Run a live smoke export from the repository root, writing generated output
outside the repo:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai/data/vals-ai
```

To intentionally prepare a data refresh, use `--output-dir data/vals-ai` and
validate the result before deciding whether to include generated files.

For smaller smoke runs, fetch one benchmark:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --benchmark finance_agent \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai-smoke/data/vals-ai \
  --save-raw-json /tmp/eee-vals-ai-raw.json
```

Replay a saved normalized payload without hitting the network:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --input-json /tmp/eee-vals-ai-raw.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai-replay/data/vals-ai
```

Validate generated records with:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever validate \
  '/tmp/eee-vals-ai-smoke/data/vals-ai/*/*/*.json*'
```

### Vectara Hallucination Leaderboard

The adapter enumerates every per-model result file in `vectara/results` at the
pinned `SOURCE_COMMIT` and emits one record per model. Run a live export
outside the repository:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vectara_hallucination_leaderboard.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vectara/data/vectara-hallucination-leaderboard \
  --save-raw-json /tmp/eee-vectara-raw.json
```

Replay the saved snapshot without hitting the network:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vectara_hallucination_leaderboard.adapter \
  --input-json /tmp/eee-vectara-raw.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vectara-replay/data/vectara-hallucination-leaderboard
```

Bump `SOURCE_COMMIT` to pick up a newer leaderboard run. The evaluated corpus
is private, so the log records the public result file as provenance rather than
a redistributable dataset. The pinned files record no serving platform, so
`deployment_type` stays `unknown`; `model_availability` is derived from the
source's `accessibility` annotation.

Provenance that is constant for a run — the source file, commit, resolve URL,
scoring model and temperature policy — lives once in `source_metadata`. Each of
the 40 results carries only what varies, because repeating the constants on
every result doubled the size of each record. That invariant is pinned by
`test_constant_provenance_is_not_repeated_per_result`.
