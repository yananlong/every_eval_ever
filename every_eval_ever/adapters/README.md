# Adapters

One-off adapter scripts that fetch leaderboard data from external sources and convert it to the Every Eval Ever schema. These are run manually, not via the main CLI.

## Writing a new adapter

Start from the `eee-dataset-conversion` agent skill —
[`.claude/skills/eee-dataset-conversion/SKILL.md`](../../.claude/skills/eee-dataset-conversion/SKILL.md).
It carries the field semantics, the merge-gate checks (`reference/datastore-gate.md`),
runnable templates, and the datastore submission mechanics. `tests/test_skill_conversion.py`
re-validates those templates against the live validator, so they stay current.

## Usage

Each adapter is run with `uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.<name>.adapter`.

Metric bounds and direction are resolved against a vendored eval-card-registry snapshot; unknown metrics fail the run rather than getting invented bounds. Needs the `paperswithcode` extra. |

### Drug-interaction paper results

The paper adapter is offline and consumes reviewed aggregate source bundles committed
with the code. It does not download or redistribute DrugBank records. Run the source
and release audit before generating datastore records:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.drug_interaction_papers.audit \
  --block all
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.drug_interaction_papers.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-drug-interaction-papers/data
```

The Papers with Code **DrugBank leaderboard is a different source**: use the
`paperswithcode` adapter with `--dataset-slug drugbank`. PwC already supplies the
model rows and aggregate metrics; raw DrugBank XML and instance-level examples are
not inputs to that conversion.

The canonical experiment plan and its decision gates live beside the paper adapter in
`every_eval_ever/adapters/drug_interaction_papers/experiment-plan/`.

### Mercor Evaluation Exports

Set the API key in the environment and run the adapter:

```bash
export MERCOR_EVAL_API_EVALEVAL_KEY="<your-key>"
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.mercor_eval.adapter
```

For a credential-free offline smoke run:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.mercor_eval.adapter \
  --input-json tests/data/mercor_eval/api_payload.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/mercor-eval-offline
```

The adapter exports aggregate leaderboard metrics only. Mercor's criterion
results do not include the task input, model output, messages, or answer
attribution required by the EEE instance-level schema.
Records are generated under benchmark-specific datastore directories, for
example `data/apex-agents/<developer>/<model>/<uuid>.json`. Generated records
are intended for the Hugging Face datastore submission, not the GitHub adapter
PR.

### LEXam

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.lexam.adapter --output-dir data
```

One record per model, with one result per published leaderboard column:

| Metric | Evaluation | Scale | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open Question Judge Score | `lexam.open_question` | `[0,100]` | test split, n=2,541, scored by a pointwise-minimum ensemble of three judges |
| Multiple-Choice Accuracy | `lexam.mcq_4_choices` | `[0,1]` | n=1,655; the 4-choice config only, not the 8/16/32-choice ones |

The site prints both columns as percentages. Each is emitted on the scale of
its registry metric, with the published percentage kept in
`score_details.details`.

Model ids, metric ids, bounds and direction come from the eval-card-registry
through `registry_snapshot.json`, which vendors the entities this adapter emits
and is pinned to the registry revision they came from. The tests fail if an
emitted value drifts from the pin, so regenerate it after a registry change:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.lexam.refresh_registry_snapshot \
    --registry /path/to/eval-card-registry
```

Add `--check` to test the pin without writing: it exits non-zero and names both
revisions. Metric `review_status` is read from the snapshot, so a metric
promoted upstream needs a refresh rather than a code change.

Inference settings, serving and standard errors are not on the leaderboard;
they come from the paper (arXiv:2505.12864v7 §3.3, appendix F, Tables 1 and 10)
and from LEXam's own runner, `litellm_eval.py`, which names the served model for
15 of the 36 rows. Each record cites the source it used, and a standard error is
attached only while the scraped score still equals the published one.

Submission follows the datastore mechanics in the conversion skill. One
adapter-specific caveat: record filenames are fresh uuids per run, so a second
`upload_folder` onto an open submission PR adds another copy of every model.
Update a submission by deleting `data/lexam/` and adding the new records in a
single `create_commit`.

### Papers with Code

The source is a nightly PostgreSQL backup of the PwC database, published to the
HF bucket `huggingface/paperswithcode-backups` under `postgres/*.dump`
(`pg_dump -Fc`, ~180–210 MB each). Dumps are read with
[`pgdumplib`](https://pypi.org/project/pgdumplib/), so no PostgreSQL server or
`pg_restore` is needed — install the extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra paperswithcode
```

Auto-downloading the newest dump additionally needs `huggingface_hub>=1.0` for
the bucket API, above the range this repo pins. The `--dump` path (a dump
already on disk) has no such requirement, and the import is lazy, so only
auto-download fails and only when it is actually used.

```bash
# a dump already on disk, two leaderboards, no network
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.paperswithcode.adapter \
  --dump /tmp/pwc-raw/paperswithcode_hf_20260716_031511.dump \
  --dataset-slug eth3d-relative --dataset-slug re10k-2-view \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-pwc

# DrugBank leaderboard: aggregate model rows + AUROC/Accuracy/F1, no XML
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.paperswithcode.adapter \
  --dump /tmp/pwc-raw/paperswithcode_hf_20260716_031511.dump \
  --dataset-slug drugbank \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-pwc-drugbank

# download the newest dump and convert everything (large)
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.paperswithcode.adapter \
  --all --output-dir data/paperswithcode
```

PwC re-reports numbers rather than running models, so `source_type` is
`documentation`, there is no per-item data and no `_samples.jsonl`. One record
per canonical model id; each result is one (evaluation row × metric) pair. The
DrugBank regression fixture pins the preserved PwC leaderboard's three model rows
(CADGL, SSI-DDI, and MHCA-DDI) and nine aggregate score cells. It intentionally
preserves PwC's reported cells even where a paper reports a different evaluation
value; PwC is the reporting source for this adapter.

A re-run over the same dump is byte-stable — `retrieved_timestamp` and
`evaluation_id` are keyed on the dump date, never on wall-clock time. Because
record filenames are fresh uuids, a re-run replaces the output directory's
contents: the new batch is validated and written first, and only then are the
previous run's records removed, so a failed run leaves that run's output intact.

`continuous` metrics need a defined `min_score`/`max_score`, and PwC does not
publish them. They come from the eval-card-registry's canonical metric entries,
vendored in `registry_snapshot.json` and pinned to the registry revision they
came from, so resolution at convert time is a static lookup. A metric that is
absent from the snapshot, or whose name maps to more than one canonical id,
**fails the run** by default and is named in the report; `--allow-unresolved`
emits it with observed-range bounds flagged as such. Reported values are mapped
onto the canonical scale per `(metric, dataset)` leaderboard rather than per
score, so an all-percent board for a `[0,1]` metric is rescaled as a group and a
lone out-of-range value is flagged instead of silently divided. `metric_unit`
names that canonical scale rather than the one PwC declared, so it stays true
after a rescale; the source declaration is kept as `pwc_scale`. A score the
group decision cannot place inside the declared bounds is **not published** —
that cell is omitted and listed in the failure report, since the bounds a record
declares have to contain its score.

Every run prints a full imperfection report — unresolved metrics, unknown
directions, scale anomalies — to stderr. The mode decides only whether to abort
before publishing: strict (the default) exits non-zero before writing anything,
`--allow-unresolved` tolerates only the unresolved class, and `--best-effort`
writes everything representable with each imperfection flagged. No mode ships an
out-of-range score, so a run that dropped one still exits non-zero.

Registering a bound for a new metric is the one part of this adapter that needs
human judgment; [`METRIC_MAINTENANCE.md`](paperswithcode/METRIC_MAINTENANCE.md)
is the procedure, including the observed-range cross-check that keeps a cited
bound honest. Refresh the snapshot after any registry change:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.paperswithcode.refresh_registry_snapshot \
    --seed /path/to/eval-card-registry/seed/metrics.yaml
```

Model ids use the HF `developer/model` form when `hf_model_url` is present.
Effort/mode tiers in PwC model names (`GPT-5.5 Pro (xhigh)`) are kept verbatim;
collapsing them and aliasing the ids belongs in the registry, not here. Bare
research-method names need a paper-linked identity rather than an `unknown`
developer; the DrugBank fixture covers that path explicitly.

## Notes

- These are one-off scripts, not integrated into the main CLI.
- They require network access to fetch live leaderboard data, except explicitly offline adapters such as `drug_interaction_papers` and replaying a local PwC dump with `--dump`.
- Some adapters (e.g. `rewardbench`, `helm`) may take several minutes to complete due to the number of models.
- Run `uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.<name>.adapter --help` for adapter-specific options.
- Generated adapter outputs under `data/<source>/` and saved raw payloads are
  generated artifacts. Prefer temporary output paths for smoke runs unless a
  data refresh is intentionally part of the change.

### Legacy integrations

`arc_agi`, `livecodebenchpro`, and `mercor_eval` are retained for historical
and offline use, but their upstream sources are no longer usable for an active
refresh (`mercor_eval` currently returns an empty response). They are excluded
from active-adapter migration and compliance requirements. Deterministic
offline tests for their existing behavior may remain in the test suite.

### Partial conversions and provenance

An adapter may encounter a source row or metric that cannot be represented as
a valid EEE record—for example, a missing model identity or a non-numeric
score. It still writes every valid record. It also writes a strict JSON
provenance report under `adapter_reports/`, outside `data/`, with the source
reference, raw source fragment when available, and reason for each omission.
The command then exits non-zero so automation can distinguish a complete
refresh from a partial one.

Intentional non-evaluation rows, such as a published random baseline, are
recorded as exclusions in the same report but do not make the command fail.
The report is not an `EvaluationLog` and must not be passed to the validator.

### Vals.ai

Run a live smoke export from the repository root, writing generated output
outside the repo:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai/data/vals-ai
```

To intentionally prepare a data refresh, use `--output-dir data/vals-ai` and
validate the result before deciding whether to include generated files.

For smaller smoke runs, fetch one benchmark:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --benchmark finance_agent \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai-smoke/data/vals-ai \
  --save-raw-json /tmp/eee-vals-ai-raw.json
```

Replay a saved normalized payload without hitting the network:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vals_ai.adapter \
  --input-json /tmp/eee-vals-ai-raw.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vals-ai-replay/data/vals-ai
```

Validate generated records with:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever validate \
  '/tmp/eee-vals-ai-smoke/data/vals-ai/*/*/*.json*'
```

### Vectara Hallucination Leaderboard

The adapter enumerates every per-model result file in `vectara/results` at the
pinned `SOURCE_COMMIT` and emits one record per model. Run a live export
outside the repository:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vectara_hallucination_leaderboard.adapter \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vectara/data/vectara-hallucination-leaderboard \
  --save-raw-json /tmp/eee-vectara-raw.json
```

Replay the saved snapshot without hitting the network:

```bash
uv run python -m every_eval_ever.adapters.vectara_hallucination_leaderboard.adapter \
  --input-json /tmp/eee-vectara-raw.json \
  --output-dir /tmp/eee-vectara-replay/data/vectara-hallucination-leaderboard
```

Bump `SOURCE_COMMIT` to pick up a newer leaderboard run. The evaluated corpus
is private, so the log records the public result file as provenance rather than
a redistributable dataset. The pinned files record no serving platform, so
`deployment_type` stays `unknown`; `model_availability` is derived from the
source's `accessibility` annotation.

Provenance that is constant for a run — the source file, commit, resolve URL,
scoring model and temperature policy — lives once in `source_metadata`. Each of
the 40 results carries only what varies, because repeating the constants on
every result doubled the size of each record. That invariant is pinned by
`test_constant_provenance_is_not_repeated_per_result`.
