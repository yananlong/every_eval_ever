# Aggregate fields — what each holds, what confuses people, the fix

*Scope: aggregate `EvaluationLog` field semantics. Instance/jsonl fields →
`instance-level.md`; deeper failure modes → `gotchas.md`.*

Two collision clusters cause most of the mistakes:
- **"where from?" is three fields:** `source_metadata` (who *reported*),
  `source_data` (the *dataset*), the per-score *citation* (no typed home).
- **"what's its name?" is three fields:** `evaluation_name` (the eval),
  `metric_config.metric_name` (the metric), `source_metadata.source_name` (the venue).

## §sources — sweep every surface before calling a field missing
One eval is documented across many places, and which fact lives where varies per
dataset — so treat no location as fixed. A field is "unknown" only after you have
**swept the surfaces below** and it is on none of them; recorded-missing because you
checked one page is the failure this heads off. Fields most often blanked when the
answer *did* exist elsewhere: metric range/definition, the harness
(`eval_library`), `source_data` provenance (incl. `hf_repo`/`hf_split`), timestamps.

**Surfaces to sweep:** paper (PDF and arXiv HTML — the appendix often has the
metric definition) · GitHub README + `docs/` · the results dump/dataset · each
benchmark's own dataset repo · its HF dataset card · the HF model card ·
the leaderboard's pages/tabs/API · blog or release announcement.

**Coverage and fill are separate decisions — don't conflate them.**
- *Coverage:* take in every value relevant to the exact (model, benchmark, metric,
  run) you're converting, wherever it lives — the operator's pointer is a starting
  point, not the boundary. But **don't mix in irrelevant data** (a different model
  variant, another metric, a superseded arXiv version, a run under other settings).
  **Relevance is the bound**, not required-vs-optional and not effort: optional fields
  get the same look as required ones.
- *Fill:* set a field iff the sources you gathered actually provide it; else
  **leave it empty** — emptiness reflects the sources, not how hard you looked. Never
  guess to fill; never skip a look because a field is "just optional."
  (Required fields can't simply be omitted — use the defined fallback where one
  exists, e.g. `eval_library: "unknown"`; if none fits, ask the operator, don't guess.)

A gated or login-walled surface is an operator call: don't self-authenticate
or accept a gate — flag what you couldn't reach.

When surfaces disagree, prefer the more primary (raw dump > paper > leaderboard >
blog) and log which surface + its date/version (arXiv vN, dataset revision,
leaderboard snapshot — none has a typed field, so it goes in the log or
`additional_details`) per contested value. Verify cheaply: `source_data` must be a
repo that actually exists, not just a name in a table.

## §shape — decide before writing code
1. **What artifact do you hold?** — this, not who ran the compute, sets `source_type`:
   raw per-item outputs → `evaluation_run`, only-aggregate numbers → `documentation`.
   Item-level data is the strong tell. Full rule + the cases it decides: source_metadata
   below.
2. **Aggregate-only or item-level?** headline per (model, benchmark) → aggregate
   `.json` (always); per-example too → instance `_samples.jsonl` (see
   `instance-level.md`).
3. **Grain?** default = one log per model, all benchmarks in
   `evaluation_results[]`; use one log per (model, benchmark) only when a
   benchmark has many subtasks and/or its own per-benchmark instance sidecar.

## §collection — the output directory is derived, so choose it on purpose
Records land at `data/<collection>/<developer>/<model>/<uuid>.json`, and `<collection>`
comes from **`evaluation_results[0].source_data.dataset_name`** unless you pass
`collection_override` to the publisher.
- **One collection per source you converted.** For a single-benchmark source the two
  coincide and the benchmark name *is* the collection (`data/mmlu-pro/`, `data/hle/`).
  For a multi-benchmark leaderboard, namespace the collection by the source
  (`data/vals-ai/`, `data/hal-<benchmark>/`): fanning out into bare `data/gaia/`,
  `data/usaco/` puts your leaderboard's numbers in the same directory as everyone
  else's records for that benchmark and loses the provenance. (This was the
  maintainers' resolution on the HAL adapter.) The benchmark identity always lives in
  `evaluation_name` + `source_data` regardless.
- With the default one-log-per-model grain, the first result silently decides the
  directory — so pass `collection_override` rather than relying on result ordering.
- Collections with many sub-leaderboards need collision-proof names (`<owner>__<slug>`).
- The component rules (portable names, no `data`, `/` flattened) are enforced —
  see `datastore-gate.md` §path.

## source_metadata (per log)
- `source_type` — the artifact you hold, NOT who ran it: raw per-item run outputs
  → `evaluation_run` (even if a third party ran them); only-aggregate reported numbers
  → `documentation` (a leaderboard scrape stays `documentation` even though a pipeline
  produced the numbers). `evaluator_relationship` separately records WHO ran it. (The
  README/schema phrase it "run locally"; that under-specifies third-party raw runs —
  the artifact-you-hold test is what governs.)
- `source_name` — the platform/leaderboard, NOT the benchmark or author.
- `source_organization_name` — the aggregator/publisher org, NOT a username
  or the model developer.
- `evaluator_relationship` — relative to the model developer, not the reporter.
  A leaderboard running its own eval is still `third_party`. Enum:
  `first_party|third_party|collaborative|other` (no `self`).

## model_info
- `id` — the registry-canonical join key. Default: resolve the raw HF
  `developer/model` against the eval-card-registry resolver (hosted
  `POST /api/v1/resolve`, `entity_type:model`) and use its `canonical_id`; offer an
  opt-out flag (e.g. `--no-registry-resolve`) for speed/offline/determinism, and on
  opt-out or a network error fall back to the path id **marked unverified — never
  fatal**. Record resolution provenance (`strategy`/`confidence`/`created_new`/
  `review_status`) in `additional_details`, and surface auto-created-draft /
  low-confidence ids to the decision log (they hit the "new canonical id" ask). Don't
  invent ids; don't bake effort/mode/quant tiers in; dated snapshots are fine. See
  `registry.md`.
- **`evaluation_id` must NOT be keyed on the resolved id** — key it on the RAW source
  identity (path/repo + eval time). The registry may re-map a freshly auto-created
  draft later; a moving canonical id would break re-ingest idempotency. Resolved id =
  JOIN key (`model_info.id`); raw identity = RECORD identity (`evaluation_id`).
- `name` = raw/display; `developer` = the org; `inference_platform` (API host) vs
  `inference_engine` (vLLM) — `unknown` acceptable.
- **Derive `developer` with the shared helpers, not a private map.** `helpers.get_developer`
  / `get_model_id` hold the repo's mapping; a per-adapter `MODEL_DEVELOPER_MAP` is how the
  datastore ended up with the same models under two orgs (`qwen` vs `alibaba`,
  `moonshot-ai` vs `moonshotai`) — which also splits their directories. If a model is
  missing from the helper, extend the helper.
- Beware prefix matching when mapping names: a `startswith` rule maps
  `gpt-4.1-mini` onto `gpt-4.1`. Match exactly, longest-first.
- **Variant axes belong in `evaluation_id`, not in `model_info.id`.** When a source lists
  the same model more than once under different settings (reasoning effort, temperature,
  agent scaffold, a dated re-run), keep the canonical model id and make `evaluation_id`
  carry enough of the config to keep the rows distinct — otherwise the variants collapse
  into one identity and only one survives. Put the settings themselves in
  `generation_config` / `additional_details`.

## evaluation_results[] + source_data + metric_config
- `evaluation_name` — the eval, a namespaced dotted id (`wild.<task>.<subtask>`),
  not a free-text title.
- `evaluation_result_id` — optional stable per-result id; set it if you emit
  instance sidecars (the join key each line points at).
- `source_data` — the dataset the eval ran on (`hf_dataset`/`url`/`other`),
  NOT the results dataset and NOT the model. Verify the repo exists. `source_type:
  hf_dataset` must carry `hf_repo`; `url` needs a non-empty `url` list
  (`min_length=1` — an empty list fails); `other` with no provenance at all draws a
  warning, so prefer a real repo or URL. It also routes the output directory —
  see §collection.
- `metric_config.metric_name` — the metric (`accuracy`, `pass rate`), NOT the
  eval. Most-conflated field. `metric_kind` — the normalized family. There is **no
  `metric_type`** field.
- `metric_config.metric_id` — the cross-source join key, so always set it. The
  schema's own rule: *"Use a canonical global id when applicable (e.g. `accuracy`,
  `f1_macro`, `auroc`, `rmse`, `pass_at_k`). For benchmark/leaderboard-specific metrics,
  use a namespaced id (e.g. `rewardbench.overall`, `lmarena.elo`)."* So:
  - **A real global metric → the registry's canonical metric id** (`accuracy`, `f1`,
    `exact-match`, `pass-at-1`). Resolve it (`entity_type: metric`) — metrics are
    registry entities like models. Accuracy on a 4-choice MCQ set *is* `accuracy`;
    minting `<src>.accuracy` fragments the one join that makes the datastore worth
    querying.
  - **A leaderboard-specific construct → a namespaced or registry-slug id**
    (`rewardbench.overall`, `lmarena.elo`, `lexam-open-question-judge-score`). Better
    still, register it so the next source joins with you (the registry already
    carries e.g. `mteb-score`, `mmau-pro-open-ended-judge-score`).
  - **Never a bare semantically-empty id** — `score`/`rank`/`cost` mean something
    different on every leaderboard; namespace those or resolve them to a specific
    registry metric. This is the most repeated review comment on adapter PRs.
  - Keeping `accuracy` on two benchmarks apart is **`evaluation_name`'s job**, not the
    metric id's. Don't smuggle the benchmark into `metric_id` to get separation you
    already have.
  (Not schema-required — which is exactly why it gets omitted.)
- **The canonical *scale* is a property of the metric, and it comes from the registry
  entry — not from whatever scale the source printed.** The registry stores bounds per
  metric: every accuracy-family entry is `[0,1]`, while benchmark-specific judge scores
  (`mmau-pro-open-ended-judge-score`, `mteb-score`) are `[0,100]`. So take
  `min_score`/`max_score`/`lower_is_better`/`score_type` from the resolved entry, and
  **convert the source value onto that scale** (a leaderboard's `62.65` becomes
  `0.6265` for `accuracy`, `metric_unit: proportion`). Convert the uncertainty with
  it — a standard error is a spread in the score's units — and keep the source's raw
  figure in `score_details.details` so the conversion stays auditable. Never invent a
  bound to fit the number you scraped; if the metric isn't in the registry, register it
  from a cited definition (the `paperswithcode` adapter's `METRIC_MAINTENANCE.md` is
  the worked example) rather than guessing.
- `metric_config.llm_scoring` — required shape for judge/rubric-scored metrics:
  `judges` (≥1, and each `JudgeConfig` needs a **full `model_info`** for the judge model)
  plus `input_prompt`, the actual judging prompt template (not a paraphrase or a
  summary of it). Optional `aggregation_method`, `weight`, `expert_baseline`. Two traps:
  omitting a judge's `model_info` fails *every* file in the submission, and recording an
  `aggregation_method` the upstream didn't use (e.g. `average` when it published the
  pointwise minimum across three judges) is a valid-but-wrong record — leave the typed
  field unset and describe the real rule in `additional_details` if it has no enum.
- `metric_config.score_type` — `binary|continuous|levels`. Traps: (a) omitting it
  fires the `levels` branch → requires `level_names` and `has_unknown_level`;
  (b) `continuous` requires `min_score`+`max_score`; (c) an unbounded metric
  is allowed — set `min_score`/`max_score` to `±inf` (the library serializes it as
  the JSON string `"Infinity"`; `null` means "not provided", not unbounded — see
  gotchas.md). (The JSON schema enforces (a); pydantic `validate` does
  not — set `score_type` explicitly regardless.)
- **Bounds must contain the score.** The CLI errors when `score` falls outside
  `[min_score, max_score]`, so the bounds you declare have to be the scale the source's
  numbers are actually on: a `73.4` under `0.0–1.0` bounds fails. Pick one deliberately —
  proportion `0–1`, percent `0–100`, or genuinely unbounded `±inf` — and rescale
  explicitly if you convert. Don't invent a nominal ceiling for an open-ended metric just
  to have one (a metric that can exceed 100 is not `0–100`).
- `lower_is_better` — required; the inverse of `higher_is_better`.
- `score_details` — `score` + optional `uncertainty` (`standard_error`,
  `num_samples`) + `details` (strings).

## eval_library (per log)
- The harness that ran it (`inspect_ai`, `lm-evaluation-harness`, `helm`), NOT
  the platform/aggregator/benchmark. **Independent of `source_type`** — a
  `documentation` source can still name a *known* harness (lm-eval's
  `acc,none`/`acc_stderr,none`/`bootstrap_iters` keys; Inspect scorer keys). Use
  `"unknown"` only when genuinely unidentifiable.

## generation_config
- `generation_args` is a fixed, typed set; anything else → `additional_details`.
- `reasoning` is a bool, not an effort level; there is no typed `effort`.

## timestamps
- `retrieved_timestamp` — required string epoch = when this record was created
  (now).
- `evaluation_timestamp` — when the eval ran (proxy with the source's date).
- Key `evaluation_id` on a stable value (eval time / dataset version / raw source
  id) so reruns are idempotent. **Never key it on `now`** — and never on the
  registry-resolved canonical id either (it can move; see model_info).

## additional_details (everywhere)
- **`dict[str, str]`** — `json.dumps` numbers/bools/objects first, or validation fails.

## no typed home
- Per-score citation URL, alternate candidate scores, cost/token-$ — EEE has no
  fields; they land in `additional_details` (or are dropped).
